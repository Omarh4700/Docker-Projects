# Project 1
# Task1 (🧩 Project Overview — HR App Network Setup)
This task demonstrates how to build a dedicated and isolated Docker network for a Human Resources (HR) application stack. The setup ensures service discovery via container names and avoids IP conflicts with existing VPN or corporate subnets by using a custom-defined network range. 

# Project 1
# Task2 (🌐 Project Overview — Multi-Homed Container Architecture (NGINX Load Balancer))
This project demonstrates a multi-homed container setup in Docker, where a single service — an NGINX Load Balancer — is connected to two distinct and isolated custom bridge networks.
The goal is to segregate client traffic (frontend) from internal service communication (backend), ensuring network isolation while allowing controlled routing through the load balancer.

# Project 2
# Task1 (🐳 Dockerizing a Simple Python Flask Microservice)
This project demonstrates how to containerize a lightweight Flask application serving as a health check endpoint (/).
It is part of a migration from a monolithic system to a Microservices Architecture, designed to be production-ready, secure, and Kubernetes-compatible.

# Project 2
#Task2 (🧩 Project Overview — NGINX & MySQL Local Development Stack)
This project demonstrates how to set up a local development environment for a web application using NGINX as the public-facing web server and MySQL as the backend database.
The focus is on ensuring secure service communication, persistent data storage, and developer accessibility through Docker Compose.
